## Commits
Please make sure that you stick to the commit message convention by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
So instead of having a message like this:
`fixed typescript generator`
You now have this:
`fix: typescript generator`

## Tests
Before making the PR also make sure that the tests are green.
Just run `yarn test`.

If it's a fundamental new feature (for example adding a new generator), please cover it with new tests.
